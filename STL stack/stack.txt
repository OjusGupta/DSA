five functions in stack are : 
1. empty - tells us if the stack is empty or not
2. size - how many elements does your stack contains
3. top - gives you the top element of your stack
4. push - function to add element to the stack
5. pop - to remove an element from the stack

stack uses LIFO technique: 
LIFO means - Last in, First out
(just like in case of plates)

It's a container that holds a collection of elements, and you can think of it like a stack of plates. The last plate you put on the stack is the first one you need to remove.
